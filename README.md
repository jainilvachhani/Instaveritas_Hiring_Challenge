# Instaveritas_Hiring_Challenge

Make a simple web app with Laravel/Django/RubyOnRails or any other MVC framework of your choice for ticket-booking for a music studio
You’ll also need to design the DB schema to handle the operations
Users can book a studio, for an hour, by simply selecting their preferred time
Studios will show their opening-closing time
User should be able to book a time-slot only if it is not already booked by another user
You have to create a homepage with list of studios with an option to search by name, a studio page which lets the user book the studio.
No need to work on user-authentication or anything else unless it is easily given the framework you’re using

Extra points for 
Storing and showing more data information about studios
Showing search and filter options
For cleaner code 
For optimized DB schema
